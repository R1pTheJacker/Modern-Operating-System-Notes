## 1.Batch System
### 1.1 definition
The users who using a batch operating system do not interact with the computer directly. Each user prepares its job on an off-line device like punch cards and submits it to the computer operator. To speed up the processing, jobs with similar needs are batched together and run as a group. The programmers exit their programs with the operator and the operator then sorts the programs with similar requirements into batches.

    * ***Solaris***
    * ***Linux***

- POSIX

## 3.Terminology
### 3.1 Shell
A shell is a software that provides an interface for an operating system's users to access the kernel's services.

### 3.2 System Calls
A system call is a request made by a program to the operating system. It allows an application to access the kernel through functions and commands from the operating system's API.

System calls perform system-level operations, such as communicating with hardware devices and reading and writing files.

### 3.3 Process
A process is a program that is running on your computer.

### 3.4 File System
All hard disks use a file system, which organizes all the files on the disk. The file system is created when you initialize or format your hard disk. It sets up the root directory and subsequent directories beneath it. The file system allows you to create new files and folders, which are added to different parts of the "file tree" on your hard disk.
